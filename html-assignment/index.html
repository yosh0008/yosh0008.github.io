            <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>

            <img title="Photo of me in Gero, Japan" src="/html-assignment/images/gero-desu.jpg" alt="Photo of me in Gero, Japan" width="500">

            <p>My name is Jun Yoshida. I was born and raised in Ottawa, <abbr title="Ontario">ON</abbr>. My birthday is on April 23<sup>rd</sup>. My dad is Japanese and my mom is Thai. I've visited both countries multiple times and recently went to Japan in November 2020. I have one sibling, an older brother that's 2 years older than me. I also own two cats named Kiki and Mika. Some of my hobbies include playing guitar, playing games, watching anime, lifting weights, eating good food, and hanging out with my friends. The hobby I enjoy the most out of all of them is playing guitar. Playing guitar helps me relax, but also keeps my mind active and challenges me when I learn new songs. There are some other hobbies that I want to pick up, such as learning how to play the piano, drawing, reading, creating/coding a game and cooking.</p>
           
            <p>I'm currently taking the <strong>Interactive Media Design</strong> program at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>. So far, the program is interesting and enjoyable. I <em>really</em> enjoy the <strong>Web Development I</strong> course the most so far. Learning about <strong>HTML</strong> and hearing about other things we'll be learning in the future such as <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong> made me excited to be learning new skills. I mainly took this program because of the <em>seemingly</em> good opportunities to find good jobs and because I already considered taking this program a few years ago. The only coding experience that I have is when I took a couple programming classes during high school, but didn't do too well in it due to lack of interest (during the time).</p>
            
            <p>One quote that tends to stick with me is: </p>
                <blockquote>It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters. -<cite>Epictetus</cite></blockquote>
